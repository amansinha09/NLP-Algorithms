# Lecture 1 - Introduction
What is natural language processing (NLP)? It is a study of how to make machine understand and generate natural language - by natural language we don't mean language by animals, but humans.
It is an inter disciplinary area of study - Linguistics, Theorectical Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Artificial Intellignece, Psychology, Databases, etc.

Applications: Web Search, Natural Language Assistants, Translations Systems.

Goals:
Is NLP hard and why? The rules from one language are in general not applicable to other language.

Key Problems; The methods to address them and the limitations of these methods

Language and Communication: This primarily involves two persons. The speaker and The listener.
The speaker - (i) Intent (goals, shared knowledge), (ii)Generation (tactical), and, (iii) Synthesis (text, or speech)
The listener - (i) Perception, (ii) Interpretation (Syntactic, semantic, Pragmatics), and (iii) Incorporation (Understanding)
Both the speaker and the listener should share common grounding (Context). For examples, a person in a bar could point out at a object saying, "I want this" - which would be clear to the listener.

Pipeline of NLP involves: 
```
                                        Language --(U)nderstanding--> Machine --(G)eneration--> Language.
```
Based on the requirement, sometimes we need only the first part, where we want the machine to understand the language, while the other time we want the machine to respond back in form of language as well.


# Lecture 2 - Examples of Text
There are different types of text available and each of them provide different set of challenges. For examples, a news articles may consists of different parts such as current event, background event, speculations, property, and, prenominal reference to previous sentences.

There can be different genres of text: Blogs, emails, press release, chats, debates, medical records, research articles, literary texts, etc, and of different lengths.
Poetry can be more different to understand.

# Lecture 3 - Funny Sentences
There can be also sentences that can be interpreted in different ways maybe sometimes in unintended way.
(Mostly because used phrase can have multiple interpretations)
- Lexical ambiguity 
- Structure ambiguity
- Scope ambiguity
- Others
